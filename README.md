#Winsnow

This script is a tribute to a mini-program Winsnow 1.0 Created by P.W.Tse around 1997.

There are two versions. Regular one contains b64 encoded graphics and music, second allows you to upload utils - music and graphics to some online source (requires URL edit in script, and may also need a hash update).

It does the sam thing as programs I took inspiration from (both available in inspiration folder), but in Powershell, so you may e.g. use it as remediation script in Intune :)
It displays movable menu where user can enable or disable options or close the script.

WARNING!
Utils folder and script contain b64-encoded santa claus picture and a melody taht I'm not an author of. They are found in Internet some time ago and unfortunately I don't remember authors. Treat them as only examples.
