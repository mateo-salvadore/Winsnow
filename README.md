#Winsnow

This script is a tribute to a mini-program Winsnow 1.0 Created by P.W.Tse around 1997.

It does the sam thing, but in Powershell. It also displays movable menu where user can enable or disable options.

There are two versions. Regular one contains b64 encoded graphics and music, second allows you to upload utils - music and graphics to some online source (requires URL edit in script, and may also need a hash update).

WARNING!
Utils folder and script contain b64-encoded santa claus picture and a melody taht I'm not an author of. They are found in Internet some time ago and unfortunately I don't remember authors. Treat them as only examples.
